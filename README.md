# Quori 🔒

Quori is a security-focused browser built with RPS (Random Passphrase System) authentication before use — made for Web3 users who care about wallet safety.

> 🧠 You will be shown 12 custom mnemonic words on first launch — required to unlock the browser.

## 🧪 For Web3 Users (Beta Notice)
