🔒 Quori – RPS-Gated Browser for Web3 Safety
Quori is a privacy-enhanced browser built on Chromium, designed to protect users in the Web3 space with a built-in Random Passphrase System (RPS) — a lightweight local authentication layer required before any browsing activity.

🧠 On first launch, you'll receive 12 custom mnemonic words. These are required to unlock and use the browser.

✨ Features
🔐 RPS Authentication Gate
Unlock the browser by passing a 3-of-12 word challenge selected randomly each time.
