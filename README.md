# Quori 🔒

Quori is a security-focused browser built with RPS (Random Passphrase System) authentication before use — made for Web3 users who care about wallet safety.

> 🧠 You will be shown 12 custom mnemonic words on first launch — required to unlock the browser.

## ✨ Features

- 🔐 **RPS Authentication Gate**  
  Browser must be unlocked using random 3-of-12 word validation.
  
- 🛑 **Blocks actions before verification:**  
  - Extension usage  
  - DevTools opening  
  - Any URL navigation  
  - App menu (three dots) access  
  - Bookmarks and new tabs  
  - Plugin icon clicks  

- 📜 **Login Records**  
  Successful and failed login attempts are recorded (locally).

-🛠️ Secure local storage
  The mnemonic is hashed with salt and stored safely on your local device. No data is ever transmitted externally.

-🧪 For Web3 Users (Beta Notice)
  This is a beta version of Quori. If you're a Web3 user, please follow these important safety recommendations:

  Use a brand-new test wallet — do NOT import your real wallet for testing

  Carefully write down the 12 mnemonic words shown at first launch — they will not be shown again

  If you choose to reset RPS, all stored mnemonic and verification status will be cleared and a new setup will begin

  Your local login records (success or failure) will remain intact even after a reset
